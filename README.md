# AI-Based-Pathway-Analysis-for-Understanding-Disease-Mechanism
This project applies a pathway-based sparse deep neural network (Cox-PASNet) to predict survival outcomes in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients using gene expression and clinical data, aiming for improved accuracy and biological interpretability.
